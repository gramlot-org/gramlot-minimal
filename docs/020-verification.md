## 005 · Automated checks

`npm test` checks output, no build-time Page execution, rejected Python/Node-only
inputs, CLI use and preservation of existing output on failure.
`scripts/verify_native_html_browser.mjs` opens an actual exported artifact from file,
blocks HTTP(S), and checks main, Source mutations, optional remote Source and dispose.

## 010 · Status

Local verification, 2026-09-21: all three exporter tests pass. The npm tarball is
installed in gramlot-examples Hello World; its build:standalone command succeeds
and its existing host test passes. Chrome153.0.8010.48 opens the exported Hello World
with blocked HTTP(S), typed main, Source updates/insertion/deletion and Worker cleanup.
Chrome and Playwright WebKit26.6 also pass the source-live artifact, including a
marked remote Source method executed in the Worker. WebKit is not Safari.

The 2026-09-21 verified graph used local archives: core0.0.0-dev.1, Builder JS0.1.3,
Bag JS0.5.2 (gramlot-strict-source artifact) and TYTX0.15.0. The new exporter is
0.0.0-dev.1. No manifest pin or lockfile was retained. Local installation is not
proof of fresh upstream availability; no package was published. Current native
0.1.0 delivery uses the locally prepared `@gramlot/native-html` 0.1.0 archive;
see the core's [artifact handoff](https://github.com/gramlot-org/gramlot/blob/main/docs/internal/135-release-handoff.md).
Do not equate the historical PoC showcase or the old eight-profile matrix with
verification of this exporter. Safari and Firefox remain unverified.
